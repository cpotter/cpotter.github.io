# Chris Potter Blog: ghost-render

This blog is an attempt to keep track of and organize a variety of my personal
projects.  I'm hoping that by starting this blog it will encourage me to finish
what I actually start!  This blog is the first on my list.

A few of the things on my list:
 - [Ghost/Github Blog](https://github.com/cpotter/cpotter.github.io)
 - Deck of Cards API vanilla node app
 - Record Cataloger Meteor App
 - Meteor 1000 Books by Kindergarten Meteor App
 - Sudoku Solver
 - Freeflow Solver
 - Crafty Spending App with [Charlestronauts](https://github.com/Charlestronauts)

## How was this blog built?
This blog was built using [ghost-render](https://github.com/mixu/ghost-render).  
Using github's pages to render the final blog, locally I am writing these posts
in markdown, which is ideal.
